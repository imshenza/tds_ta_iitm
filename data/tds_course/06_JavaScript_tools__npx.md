JavaScript tools: npx
npx
 is a command-line tool that comes with npm (Node Package Manager) and allows you to execute npm package binaries and run one-off commands without installing them globally. Itâ€™s essential for modern JavaScript development and data science workflows.

Running JavaScript-based data visualization tools
Converting notebooks and documents
Testing and formatting code
Running development servers
